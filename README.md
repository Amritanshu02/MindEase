## Project Overview

### ðŸ“Œ Design Philosophy

This project embraces a simple and minimalistic design ethos to ensure an intuitive and user-friendly experience. The focus is on easy navigation, enhancing the overall usability of the application.

### ðŸ“Œ Technologies Used in Backend

- **Node.js:** The backend is built on Node.js, providing a robust and scalable server environment.

- **Express:** Express.js is employed to streamline the development of the server and facilitate efficient routing.

- **MongoDB Atlas:** MongoDB Atlas is utilized as the cloud database solution, ensuring seamless data storage and retrieval.

- **Crypto-js:** Passwords are securely hashed using the crypto-js library, enhancing user data protection.

### ðŸ“Œ Authentication Workflow

1. **User Signup:**
   - Users register through a straightforward form, providing necessary details, including a password.
   - Passwords are hashed using the robust SHA-256 algorithm from the crypto-js library.
   - User information, including the hashed password, is stored securely in the MongoDB Atlas database.

2. **User Login:**
   - During login, the server searches for the user in the database.
   - If the user is not found, a JSON response of "user not found" is returned.
   - Upon locating the user, the server compares the hashed current password with the hashed registration password.
   - Successful matching results in redirection to the home page, while incorrect credentials prompt a JSON response indicating "wrong credentials."

### ðŸ“Œ Seamless User Experience

After successful registration, users are seamlessly redirected to the login page. The login process ensures a smooth experience, providing immediate feedback for user awareness.
